    "The efficient transfer of energy from solar wind into the Earth’s magnetic field causes geomagnetic storms. The resulting variations in the magnetic field increase errors in magnetic navigation. The disturbance-storm-time index, or <i>Dst</i>, is a measure of the severity of the geomagnetic storm.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a key specification of the magnetospheric dynamics, the <i>Dst</i> index is used to drive geomagnetic disturbance models such as NOAA/NCEI’s High Definition Geomagnetic Model - Real-Time (HDGM-RT).\n",

    "\n",
    "Empirical models have been proposed as early as in 1975 to forecast <i>Dst</i> solely from solar-wind observations at the Lagrangian (L1) position by satellites such as NOAA’s Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) or NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). Over the past three decades, several models were proposed for solar wind forecasting of <i>Dst</i>, including empirical, physics-based, and machine learning approaches. While the ML models generally perform better than models based on the other approaches, there is still room to improve, especially when predicting extreme events. More importantly, we intentionally sought solutions that work on the raw, real-time data streams and are agnostic to sensor malfunctions and noise.\n"

    "The architecture is somewhat similar to a widely used architecture for image segmentation, the U-Net introduced by Ronneberger, Fischer, and Brox (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597). The U-Net consists of a \"contracting path\", a series of convolutional layers which condense the image, followed by an \"expansive path\" of up-convolution layers which expand the outputs back to the scale of the original image. Combining small-scale and large-scale features allows the network to make localized predictions that also take account of larger surrounding patterns.\n",

    "The final model is an ensemble of 5 models with the same structure, trained on different subsets of the data (these are often called \"cross-validation folds\"). This is a common technique in machine learning. The idea is that each model only imperfectly captures the \"true\" relationship between the input and output variables, and partly fits to noise in the training data. But if we average several models, the random noise components will approximately cancel each other out, leaving a more accurate prediction of the true relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data is segmented by month, and for each model 20% of months are excluded. The data is split by months rather than hours because successive hours are likely to be correlated, meaning test and train sets would be more similar, reducing the benefit of the ensemble. Separate models are trained for times  𝑡  and  𝑡+1 , yielding 10 models in total. To ensure each fold contains a mixture of extreme and moderate Dst periods, we order the months by average Dst, and then leave out every fifth month for each fold (e.g. in fold 0 we exclude months 4, 9, 14..., then in fold 1 we exclude months 1, 10, 15, ...).\n",
